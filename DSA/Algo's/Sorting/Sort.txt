Types of Sorting : (BSIMQHCRBS)
-------------------

1. Bubble Sort  
2. Selection Sort  
3. Insertion Sort  
4. Merge Sort  
5. Quick Sort  
6. Heap Sort  
7. Counting Sort  
8. Radix Sort  
9. Bucket Sort  
10. Shell Sort  


In Space sorting Algorithm:
-----------------------------

     if the sorting Algorithm sort all the elements without using extra memory or,
sort all the elements with auxillary space complexity as O(1) is called In Space sorting Algorithm.

    Chat_GPT : An in-place sorting algorithm is one that requires only a constant amount of extra space beyond the input data being sorted.
The algorithm modifies the original array or list without using significant additional memory (no additional arrays or data structures).

    Example : Selection Sort, Bubble sort ,Insertion sort


Heap Sort :
------------

     Priority Queue or Priority
     --------------------------
               1. Each item in the queue is given some Priority and further dequeue operation will done based on the Priority.
               2. We can efficiently implement Priority queue based on the binary heap.


 1. Binary Heap 
 --------------

                 Binary heap is a complete binary heap tree which satisfies the heap ordering property.

    Full binary tree vs complete binary tree
    ----------------------------------------

           Full : it is a tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.

           complete : it is a full tree in which the last level may contain lesser nodes but it should be as left as possible.

    Min Heap vs Max Heap
    ---------------------
           Min : every parent node value will be lesser than the children's value.       






Quick Sort:

                   1. Divide and Conquer algorithm. 
                   2. Three major task : 1. PIVOT element Selection 2. Partition function(Partition logic) 3. Sub arrays
                   3. PIndex - Partition variable : i - iterating variable
